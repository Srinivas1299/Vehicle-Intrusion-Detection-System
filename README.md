ðŸš— Vehicle Intrusion Detection System (VIDS)
Face Authentication + Number Plate Recognition using ML (XGBoost & SVM)

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Vehicle Intrusion Detection System (VIDS) is a security system that verifies vehicle access using Face Recognition and Number Plate Recognition. It uses:

Face Recognition with XGBoost to authenticate vehicle owners.
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with SVM to extract and validate number plates.
OpenCV for image processing and Python for implementation.
ðŸ”¹ Use Case: Enhancing security in parking lots, gated communities, and restricted areas.
